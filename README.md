# Breast Cancer Prediction using Naive Bayes

This project aims to predict the likelihood of breast cancer using the Naive Bayes algorithm. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm commonly used for classification tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be obtained from Kaggle: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or above
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## Installation
To install the required packages, execute the following command:


## Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the Naive Bayes model, and make predictions.
5. Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different preprocessing techniques or machine learning algorithms to enhance the prediction accuracy.

Please note that this project is an implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm for breast cancer prediction and is meant for educational and experimental purposes. It is always recommended to consult medical professionals for accurate diagnosis and treatment of any health-related concerns.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to ask.
